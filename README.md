## Usage
### Clearing the Graph
Starting afresh is often needed. The clear_graph tool facilitates this.
1.	Set Up: Open clear_graph.py. Make sure the Neo4j database connection details match your setup.
2.	Run: Execute the script. It'll erase all nodes and relationships.
### Building the Knowledge Graph
To populate your Neo4j instance with meaningful data, use the knowledge graph utility.
1.	Preparation: Make sure your data source is accessible and formatted appropriately.
2.	Run: Kickstart the process with the knowledge_graph.py script. It will ingest the data and construct the graph in your Neo4j instance.
### Knowledge Graph Visualizer
Engage with your graph data through an intuitive web interface.
1.	Initiate: Launch the utility using the knowledge_graph_visualizer.py script.
2.	Access: Point your browser to http://localhost:8000.
3.	Interact: The interface is powered by Cypher queries. Here's how to navigate:
   
 	i)Enter your Cypher query in the textbox.

 	ii)Hit "Execute Query".

	iii)View results in a user-friendly card format, detailing attributes for easy comprehension.

Dive deep, explore relationships, or get a birds-eye view â€“ this visualizer is your passport to the Neo4j world.
